# MOTUS - Arduino Based Robotic Car Controlled Wirelessly Using Leap Motion Sensor

## Abstract

Motus is a robotic three wheeler vehicle built using 2-DC brushless 4 volt motors, Arduino UNO microcontroller, micro servo SG90 motor, caster wheel/directional wheel, and a turning mechanism controlled using Leap Motion Controller. The system can be consolidated into three components: Leap motion create VR-Virtual Reality environment, circuit proceeds and transmits signals, and the DC motors and servo motors provides the feedback. All signals transmit through the bluetooth module HC-05 connected to Arduino UNO microcontroller along with the laptopâ€™s bluetooth. The system involves the use of both software and hardware. A 12 volt DC lithium ion battery is the only source of power. The Motus enhances the human interaction with hardware experience in the real world.
